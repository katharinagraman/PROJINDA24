The repository is my project assignment for my first year in computer engineering. It is an interactive calendar made for students in university

### Introduction
Students in university will often struggle with time management especially during their first year.
To help students with their planning and making it customed to their tight schedules and intense schedule
this projects aims to make planning efficient and easily accessible for students.


### Project idea
An interactive planner/calendar with these features:
* Hamburger menu that updates every day
  * Shows today's tasks that the student has noted or events
    * "Study Math", "Laundry" , "VÃ¥rbal"
* A Calendar, where each day has a linked page where all tasks are illustrated
  * each noted thing can be a `Task` , `Event`, `Chore` or `Other`

* For tasks, students can start growing a plant, and the idea is that the student can't use their device or else the plant dies
* Events are highlighted in the hamburger menu, to give a optimistic feel when student looks
* A chores are also highlighted
