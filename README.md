# PROJINDA24
The repository is my project assignment for my first year in data engineering. It is an interactive calendar intended
to help students to better organise their days.

### Introduction
Students in university often struggle with time management, especially during their first year.
To help students with their planning during tight schedules this projects aims to make planning efficient and easily accessible for students.


### Project idea
An interactive planner/calendar with these features:
* Hamburger menu that updates every day.
  * Shows today's tasks that the student has noted or events
    * "Study Math", "Laundry" , "VÃ¥rbal"
    * Easily accessed from home page
* A Calendar, where each day has a linked page where all tasks are illustrated
  * each noted thing can be a `Task` , `Event`, `Chore` or `School`

* For tasks, students can start growing a plant, and the idea is that the student can't use their device or else the plant dies
* Events are highlighted in the hamburger menu, to give an optimistic feel when student looks
* A chores are also highlighted


### Project composition

#### EventListener
* Interface that prompts an action to happen to the Day object when called in EventGUI and RemoveEventGUI

#### DayDesign
